# aoc2019 (redux)

I had to redo a few of my [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019) solutions
because I originally did Advent of Code 2019 using a different account,
and a few of [my old solutions](https://github.com/armsnyder/aoc2019) were not generalizable.

Usage:

```
$ go run . [-d day] [-2]
```

Requires a `session.txt` file containing a session token, for pulling puzzle input and submitting answers.
(Inputs and answers are cached.)
